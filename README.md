  These were the files I made during project 3. The code is to be an item tracking program. Basically it takes a list of items purchased in order, and then outputs in various formats how may items were purchased. The three options are searching for a specific item
the entire list with the number purchased next to them, and then the list with a number of symbols afterwards instead of the number instead (to give a visual indicator of items). It also outputs a file with the list from the second option. I think one thing I did well
in this code is checking for the correct input. I actually used it at one point while debugging as I had an error in the naming convention of my input file. Because of my feedback from the program it was easy to fix the code. I think a way to make the code better 
would be a more efficient way of importing the data. Right now the only way for the data to be imported is with a text file with a specific name. To input new data you'd have to edit the code or edit the text file. This can work, but it sounds like a pretty crude way
of doing things. The most difficult part of the code for me was keeping all of my variables straight. I ended up keeping a seperate notepad with all of my variables used on my desk as a quick reference and it helped alot. I think this is a pretty standard request for code
and it was a very valuable experience. I tried to keep all of the code seperated with comments for each action that wasn't completely obvious.
